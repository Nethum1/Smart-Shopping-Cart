This is a Smart Shopping Cart project built using ESP32, sensors, and motor drivers to simulate intelligent automation for retail environments. The cart is designed to navigate, detect obstacles, and assist users with automated features.

ðŸš€ Features
* Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04): For real-time obstacle detection

* ESP32 Microcontroller: Handles logic control and wireless communication

* Servo Motor: Automates mechanical functions (e.g., compartment opening)

* Dual DC Motors: Enables mobility with differential drive

* On/Off Switch: Manual power control

* Custom Chassis: Assembled using laser-cut wood and recycled materials

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
* Arduino IDE

* Embedded C/C++

* ESP32 Wi-Fi Module

* Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)

* Servo & DC Motor Control

ðŸ“¦ Future Improvements
* Integration with RFID for item scanning

* Load sensors for dynamic weight tracking

* Mobile app control via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi

* Voice command (TinyML) and speech feedback (TTS)
